                        growth. Early outcomes include improved classroom spaces with better quality furniture that
                        improves the overall learning experience, hygienic meal preparation that enhances nutritional
                        value, and increased student participation in sports. </p>

                            creating inspiring spaces where children can learn, grow, and dream freely. By strengthening
                            schools and supporting students’ well-being, we hope to build strong foundations that
